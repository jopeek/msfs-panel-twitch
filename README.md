# Panel Twitch Chat

A simple web-based twitch chat viewer as a panel for use in Microsoft Flight Simulator. This is meant to make it easier to view a twitch stream's chat while flying. It is especially designed for VR users who stream and want to keep an eye on their chat, but it can also be used for streamers without multiple monitors.

## Acknowledgements

Forked from https://github.com/diagonalization-lab/msfs-panel-notepad which in turn was based on https://github.com/bymaximus/msfs2020-toolbar-window-template. 

## Prerequisites

You will need the MSFS SDK.

## Build

1. Run `build.bat`. 

This builds the package and drops the package folder into .\Packages\panel-twitch. This is the folder that needs to be copied into the *Community* folder.
